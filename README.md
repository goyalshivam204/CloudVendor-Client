# CloudVendor Frontend Application

## Description

### Overview
This project involves the development of a frontend application for the CloudVendor API, a RESTful API providing endpoints for managing cloud vendors' information. The goal is to create a user-friendly web application enabling users to interact with the CloudVendor API and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on vendor data.

### Features
#### Vendor List
- Display a list of all cloud vendors, including their name, address, and phone number.
- Users can view the details of each vendor by clicking on a vendor from the list.

#### Vendor Details
- Show detailed information about a specific vendor, including their name, address, and phone number.
- Users can navigate back to the vendor list from the details page.

#### Create Vendor
- Provide a form for users to create a new cloud vendor.
- The form includes fields for entering the vendor's name, address, and phone number.
- Upon submission, the new vendor is created and added to the vendor list.

#### Update Vendor
- Allow users to update the information of an existing vendor.
- Users can edit the vendor's name, address, and phone number through a form.
- Upon submission, the updated vendor details are sent to the API to update the corresponding vendor.
